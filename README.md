# PortSwigger All Labs – My Personal Notes

This repository contains all of my **personal notes, experiments, and writeups** for the labs I solved on the **PortSwigger Web Security Academy**.

I created this repo to track my progress, organize what I learned, and build a clean portfolio of my manual web security testing skills.

## 🔍 What’s Inside?

Each lab has its own folder and includes:
- My personal notes (`notes.md`)
- Important requests/responses I captured
- Key takeaways and logic behind the vulnerability
- Manual testing tips I can reuse in real pentests
- (Optional) screenshots

Labs are grouped by category and difficulty:
portswigger/
└── authentication/
├── apprentice/
├── practitioner/
└── expert/

## 🎯 Purpose

- Strengthen my understanding of web security vulnerabilities  
- Practice manual exploitation without relying on automated tools  
- Build a public and transparent learning journey  
- Showcase my skills for future employers and pentest projects  

## 🛠️ Categories (currently working on)

- Authentication
- Access Control (coming soon)
- Cross-Site Scripting
- Business Logic
- SSRF
- SQL Injection
- And many more…

I will continue adding new labs regularly.

## 📌 Note

These files are **NOT official solutions**.  
They are **my personal learning notes**, approaches, mistakes, and lessons I discovered while solving the labs.
